# Passager counter app

Simple passager counter app made with vanilla javascript. Originally from Scrimba's vanilla javascript course, so based on the course application I made some CSS changes. I'm going to leave this application open source so that everyone can change it in the same way, being able to add its style, with its color palettes, new features, code improvements, etc.

- Feel free to change the CSS to put your design.
- Try to add new features (Like a reset button to the previous entries).
